# Data Summary



# Note for developers:
1. You may face Windows Latin Encoding errors with data, use Linux system for preprocessing.
2. Don't use '\n' for appending new lines with given data while writing data files into .txt files. Sumerian has data is not compatible with it, you will end with uneven parallel phrases. To handle this situation, use dataframe and write data into .csv files.
