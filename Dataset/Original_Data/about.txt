sum_eng_train.csv: File contains 16017 Sumerian and English language pairs.
sum_eng_test.csv: File contains 1933 Sumerian and English language pairs.
sum_eng_develop.csv: File contains 2059 Sumerian and English language pairs.

As the name suggests train file can be used for training model, Final performance of the model should be on test files.
Develop file are standard development file. Can be used for hyperparameter tuning and evaluation. Can also be used as a validation set.

.txt files are same dataset parallel phrases in another file format.
Some redundant phrases were removed from CVS files, so you may observe that they have fewer phrases that .csv files. 

NOTE: Dataset contains only short phrases, data is noisy, incomplete and too small for implementing neural machine translation models, there are some missing phrases too denoted by "xxxx".
The organization is looking for some ways for data augmentation, probably learning embeddings from external corpora to augment the translation performance of the models.
