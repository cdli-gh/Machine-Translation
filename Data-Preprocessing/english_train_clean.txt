with their war and battle

his beloved mistress ,
in those wars and battles
he was repeatedly victorious .
Their head warriors
he mowed down .
Their runners
he weakened ( ? ) .
Their strong and weak
he killed like dogs .
The heads of their righteous and treacherous ones ( alike )
he strewed like seeds .

The young men

had fallen out ,

like ( fleeing ) birds had saved their lives ,
did not escape his hand .
Towards their cities
like an Anzu-eagle he himself
screeched .
Their settled cities and towns
he made into ruined mounds ,
and their walls
he demolished .
The young men of their cities
which he had conquered
he removed their eyes ,
and in the orchards of Enlil
in the orchards of the great gods
he made them into domestic servants .
Further , the young women
of those cities
in the weaving-houses
the temples of the great gods
he offered as gifts .
Their cattle , sheep , goats and donkeys

and in the temples of Enlil
he sacrificed them .
Gold and silver

he filled .
Copper ,

he tied onto the backs of donkeys ,

given supreme power
that from this day foreward
the praise of them
should not fall from the lips ,
but should ( rather ) be handed down -
